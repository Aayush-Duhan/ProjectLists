                        heavily on human operators to monitor camera feeds, leading to inefficiencies and delayed threat
                        detection. These systems are prone to human error, are resource-intensive, and lack the ability
                        to provide real-time insights. With the increasing frequency of crimes and threats in public and
                        private spaces, there is a pressing need for intelligent systems that can automate threat
                        detection, reduce response times, and operate reliably under diverse conditions. A</span>

                        facilitate early diagnosis, enabling timely medical intervention to improve patient outcomes.
                        Additionally, the goal is to provide real-time analysis for emergency and critical care
                        situations, helping medical professionals make quick and informed decisions.</span>
